# Sudoku Solver with Genetic Algorithmsüßë‚Äçüíª
This program implements Genetic Algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles using advanced AI techniques. Sudoku is a challenging logic-based puzzle game where the goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits exactly once. Our project takes on this challenge by harnessing the power of Genetic Algorithms, a computational method inspired by natural selection.

 <h2> Key Features: üîë </h2>:
Genetic Algorithm Core: Our solver employs a Genetic Algorithm as its primary mechanism, evolving and optimizing solutions to conquer Sudoku puzzles.
AI Techniques: Utilizes various AI techniques, including fitness evaluation, crossover, mutation, and selection, to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles.
Customizable: Easily configure the solver to tackle Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties and grid sizes.
Performance: Ensures fast and reliable Sudoku solving using efficient algorithms.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with Sudoku puzzles and viewing solutions.
